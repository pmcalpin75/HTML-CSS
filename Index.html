    <h1>HTML&CSS</h1>

 <p>First, we need to learn some basic HTML.</p>  
 
 <h2>Headings</h2>
 <p>Headings define the outline of your site. There are six levels of
    headings.</p>


<h2>Lists</h2>
<p>Add a "ul" element (it stands for unordered list)</p>
<ul>
    <li>Add a "ul" element (it stands for unordered list)</li>
    <li>Add each item in its own "li" element</li>
    <li>They don't need to be in any particular order</li>
</ul>
<p>This is what an ordered list looks like:</p>
<ol><li>Notice the new "ol" element wrapping everything</li>
    <li>But, the list item elements are the same</li>
    <li>Also note how the numbers increment on their own</li>
    <li>
      You should be noticing things in this precise order, because this is an
      ordered list
    </li></ol>
